          <h5>My Background</h5>

          <p>
            Growing up in a small, rural, and peaceful town, I used to be
            fascinated with scientific innovation shows on the TV. From there,
            my interest in science and engineering grew. My childhood dream is
            actually to be a scientist, but that was because i did not know much
            about the world yet, hence I associate innovation and invention job with scientist. I
            also believe that i am blessed with good brain, making me to be able
            to keep up with those A students ( well, just manage to keep up, not
            overtake hehe) This allowed me to be in a Science-stream class until
            the end of my STPM. From there, I decided to go into engineering
            course as it feels closer to what i want.
          </p>

          However, the process of getting my foot into the engineering world
          was not easy. As a kampung boy, money is always something that is lacking to me and
          my family. This struggle started to be more apparent when i stepped
          into middle school. Walking for 20 minutes to school everyday, helping
          my mother in pasar selling vegetables, and not having alot of pocket
          money had been my normal routine during half of my middle school. This
          drives me to learn more about financial stuff just so that i can
          reduce my parent's burden.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          After STPM, my application to get into public university was rejected
          due to my average STPM result and my ethnicity. But, since the only
          way that i know that can help me out of poverty is by getting a
          university degree and get a better paying job, i took 3 years as a gap
          year to earn enough money to enroll in a private university. Besides
          that, I also became a part-time Grab Driver to support myself during my university time.

            After graduating with Mechatronic Engineering Degree, I realized
            that most engineering fields in Malaysia does not really pays
            well, especially to fresh graduate. This is apparently due to the
            abundant of engineers in the job market. My final year in university
            did made me think a lot about what should I do to move out from
            the B40 group status into at least M40.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
              If there is one thing that I learned in university, is that I am quite good in programming. I also learned that the tech industry 
              pays well, with remote job being one of the perks. So when this opportunity came by, I did not hesitate to 
              quit from my part-time job as a kitchen crew. I would like to thank Sigma School for this opportunity and I would do my best to make use of this
              opportunity.

            Funny thing is, I got into volleyball because the school did not
            have enough players and me being a Form 5 student, I tried to get more
            co-curiculum points before graduating my middle school. Since our
            interests aligned, I joined the school team. From there, volleyball
            has been my favourite sport until now. No matter how busy I am, I
            would try to play at least once a week these days as my exercise.

            This has been one of the go-to method for me to chill whenever I
            felt tired. I enjoy playing RPG games as it make me feels like I am
            the one in the game clearing some quests and puzzles. I also enjoyed
            playing multiplayer games as it is more enjoyable to chat with
            another person. However these days, I only play Genshin Impact as a
            small relaxing session.

            I gotta admit, those tear-jerking scenes really got me. However, I
            also appreciate a good storyline in shows or movies, which can be
            found in a lot of anime shows or k-dramas. It is another means of
            relaxing whenever I am lazy to move my body and play games.
